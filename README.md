As I was going through some trouble I had several Notebooks, but these are the most importatnt ones, since I did most of the preprocessing in one and then the graphs, visuals and descriptions in Notebook1

I know this is not the best approach. I tried uploading the datasets I used, but those were too big to upload here. 

**NOTE**

I could not upload the Jupyer Notebook for Notebook 1, because it's too big for some reason. I think because of the GEOJSON. So i had to uload the code as an HTML
